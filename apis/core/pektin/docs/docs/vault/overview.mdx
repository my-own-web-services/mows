# Pektin Vault Config

Vault serves four main purposes in the Pektin setup

-   Handle update and access control of API keys
-   Supply the Pektin Config to clients
-   Statically sign records when they are created with Pektin API
-   Handle certificate distribution

It is suggested that you **don't use** this Vault instance for other purposes.
