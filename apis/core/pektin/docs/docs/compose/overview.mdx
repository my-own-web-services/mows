# Pektin Docker Compose

:::caution
Only Linux systems are supported
:::

## Overview

You can install Pektin Compose [manually](/docs/compose/install/manually) or with [Ansible](/docs/compose/install/ansible/hetzner) (Currently only Hetzner Cloud is fully automated).

If you want to go on with the manual installation and haven't set up docker and docker-compose yet please refer to the [Prerequisites](/docs/compose/prerequisites/install-docker) section.

## Goals

-   Easy to deploy
-   Includes everything
-   Get production ready fast
-   Best practices per default
-   Highly configurable

## Why not use Docker Swarm

I tried to use Docker Swarm but it is not possible to use it for Pektin for a variety of reasons.
