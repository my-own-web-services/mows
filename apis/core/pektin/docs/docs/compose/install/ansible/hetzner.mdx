# Hetzner Cloud

This is meant to be a one click install on Hetzner Cloud.
(Provided you don't need to login/register)

:::caution
This will cost money! The hcloud plugin will auto buy/rent the necessary servers.
The basic setup will rent 1 virtual server and cost you `4.15€` per month.
:::

:::tip
By signing up at Hetzner Cloud using [our referral link](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=fw5W56UYuYvy) you will get 20€
in cloud credits to tinker around with. If you like their service and stick arround to spend at
least 10€ of actual money we will get 10€ in cloud credits ourselves.

## Installation

### Required software

-   docker
-   bash
-   ssh-keygen

:::tip
Ansible itself is not required as we run it in docker
:::

1. Clone the pektin-compose-ansible repo:

<Tabs groupId="git-type">

<TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab" default>

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/pektin/pektin-compose-ansible
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="github" label="GitHub">

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pektin-dns/pektin-compose-ansible
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="git.y.gy" label="git.y.gy">

```shell
git clone https://git.y.gy/pektin/pektin-compose-ansible
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

2. Create the new file `pektin-compose-ansible/playbooks/hcloud.yml`
   and paste the following content into it:

```yaml
plugin: hcloud
token: REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN
keyed_groups:
    - key: labels
      prefix: hcloud_labels
```

3. Create a new Project in Hetzner Cloud

4. Go to: `your new project > security > api-tokens > create new token > select read-write`

5. Copy the token and paste it into the `pektin-compose-ansible/playbooks/hcloud.yml` file

6. Adjust the `pektin-config.json`

    6.1 Give a name to your public key under `ansible.sshPubKeyName`

7. Edit the `setup.sh` file and replace the value/path of `YOUR_SSH_PUB_KEY=/home/paul/.ssh/blackbox.pub` with the path to your public key. This will add your public key to all the machines Pektin is getting installed on so that you can ssh into them later.

8. If this is your first time running the playbook run `bash create-keys.sh` to create some new SSH keys used for the installation

9. Run `bash setup.sh` to start the installation
