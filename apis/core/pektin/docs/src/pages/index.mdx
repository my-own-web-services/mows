# Pektin Documentation

<br />

## What is Pektin?

Pektin is a highly opinionated authoritative DNS server with an API, user interface and much more.

## Why use Pektin?

-   No more zone files üôè
-   Ultra fast ‚ö°
-   API controllable ü§ñ
-   Memory safe Rust ü¶Ä
-   Don't rely on one API key that can do everything üîí
-   Easy to use UI with many powerful features üíª
-   Support for DOT, DOH and of course plain DNS üì°
-   DNSSEC üîê
-   Easy certificate generation üìú
-   Fully Open Source üíñ
-   Scalable üíØ
-   Privacy first üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è
-   Easy deployment with Docker Compose, Ansible and Helm üê≥üÖ∞Ô∏è‚ò∏Ô∏è
-   Easy use with [mailcow](https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized) üì¨üêÆüê≥ (Self host all the things!)
-   Small image sizes üíæ

## When NOT to use Pektin

-   It's not recommended to use Pektin outside of the provided Docker Compose and/or Helm repos.
-   Pektin is not a recursive resolver
-   Pektin is not intended to be used with other DNS software like PowerDNS or BIND9

## What is opinionated?

These things are opinionated although many of them can be expanded on or adjusted manually if needed.
We chose these things to make it easier to provide the features that we needed/wanted.

-   No support for every last DNS type (Supported are: AAAA, A, SOA, NS, CAA, CNAME, MX, SRV, TXT, TLSA, OPENPGPKEY) You sure can request an addition to the list of supported types.
-   Replication between multiple authoritative servers is done via Keydb not via DNS
-   This is NOT a recursive DNS server
-   DNSSEC only with method 13 (ECDSA-P256-SHA256)
-   DNSSEC is enabled by default
-   DNSSEC signing is offloaded to Vault
-   Primary focus is deployment to container environments (Docker, Kubernetes etc.)
-   Keydb as data store
-   Uses Vekehr as reverse proxy

## Why host your own DNS server?

-   Privacy and better compliance with the EU GDPR
-   Security
-   All domains in one place instead of having them spread out over multiple registrars
-   Easy certificate generation
-   Coolness üòé

## How do I get started?

### [Docker Compose](/docs/compose/overview)

### [Kubernetes - Helm](/docs/helm/overview)

## Architecture

![Diagram of the Pektin Architecture](/img/pektin.drawio.svg)

Ohh no so many containers! This must be huge and complicated!<br />
**It is not.**

A core focus was to make it as easy to host your own DNS server as using [mailcow](https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized) (A project we love for it's simplicity and ease of use)

**Image sizes:**<br />
API - 3MB<br />
Server - 2MB<br />
UI - 2MB<br />
Ribston - 41MB<br />
Vault - 69MB<br />
Keydb - 10MB

### Server

A DNS-Server providing plain DNS, DNS over HTTP and DNS over TLS

This container is **not** able to sign, nor to do any other authoritative work. **It just delivers records** from [Keydb](https://keydb.io/) to the clients.

### [Keydb](https://keydb.io/)

Used as fast replicated datastore to keep and distribute the DNS records from the API to the servers.

### API

Creates the DNS records that are set in [Keydb](https://github.com/Snapchat/KeyDB) formated in JSON.

It can't sign records by itself. The signing is offloaded to [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) which provides signing as a service keeping your DNS keys as secure as possible.

A clients request gets checked for validity and then put through the APIs [authorization mechanism](#ribstonopa-policy-agent).

### [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)

Used for signing the DNS records with its [transit engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/secret/transit) as well as for keeping the Pektin configuration, registrar API keys and other secrets needed for the Pektin APIs [authorization mechanism](#ribstonopa-policy-agent).

### UI

Standalone web-UI without any dynamic backend to have easy control over the multi container system.

A React app served by our own simple high performance static web server [feoco](https://github.com/pektin-dns/feoco) (**609KB**).
We dropped nginx because of its less than optimal configuration possibilities.

### Trinitrotoluol (TNT)

TNT is just an addition for UI to perform DOH queries and not meant for publicly serving DNS records.

### Ribston/OPA (Policy Agent)

As we don't want to have a single API token for everything like other DNS Servers or registrars, we need a way to check if a client is authorized to perform a request. The most common way to achieve this are ACLs or similar mechanisms that are all fast to evaluate but not very fine grained. We decided to use the **most fine grained** and **flexible** mechanism we have available: **Programming**

With programmable policies we are able to only allow a client to have access to a specific subdomain and RRType. The preconfigured acme client for example is only allowed to access the `_acme-challenge` subdomain and the `TXT` RRType.

You can do anything you never wanted like only allowing access at a specific time of day or more useful things like restricting the clients access to a specific IP address.

#### [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)

We tried using OPA for this purpose, but found that it is not exactly what we needed for our use case and also difficult to write a complex policy for. OPA is planed to be usable with the API but only if someone other than us gets arround to write the standard policies for it.

#### Ribston

We liked the concept of programmable policies though, so we created our own policy agent.

The policies are written in TypeScript/JavaScript and are evaluated using the Deno JavaScript runtime spawning workers and/or subprocesses to evaluate the given policies.

This enables you to write your own policies without a degree in Rego (OPAs policy language) and to use all established devtools for JS/TS.

The evaluation is nearly as fast as using OPA but the IPC overhead is slowing it down a lot.
Evaluation takes about 0.1ms but IPC overhead is about 4-8ms.

Policies are evaluated in parallel.

### Zertificat

is used to generate certificates with ACME and Pektin and store them in Vault.

### Verkehr

is a reverse proxy inspired and similar to Traefik. It is used to:

-   terminate TLS
-   Proxy requests to internal service endpoints
-   Proxy requests to external services and adding CORS headers
-   **DNS over TLS** from **plain DNS** coming from the server
-   **DNS over HTTPS** from **DNS over HTTP** coming from the server
