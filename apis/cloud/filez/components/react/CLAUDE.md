Use `pnpm build` to build the project and check if typescript has any errors

The project uses

- Vite (library mode)
- Tailwind
- Typescript
- React
- Mostly react class components
- shadcn and radixui

Style:

- only arrow functions
- All constants defined in constants.ts, local storage access keys for example
- No fallback translations in the components
- translations must be added to the translation type
