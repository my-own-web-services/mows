quick edit file

inline editor

file centric aproach -> no hidden things that cant be seen like caldav and cardav in nextcloud or
things like phone tracks that are then stored somewhere else

multiple open editors like vscode
drag files into editor pane

image viewer
video viewer
markdown editor

TODO:

-   drag item on static group adds it to group
-   grid strip and list view always display a group
-   drag item into grid or list or strip adds it to group
-   clicking a group in the group panel displays its properties in the right properties panel
-   double clicking a group opens it in list view as well as in the strip
-   double clicking a file in grid or list view or in the strip displays it in the single view
-   clicking a file displays its properties in the right property panel
-   selected items are seen as selected in all views an can there be deselected etc.
-   when multiple items are selected dragging them moves them all
