Hi! My name is Paul and my project makes it easy for everyone to run their own cloud services at home, creating a more decentralized internet that is not controlled by big tech.

The past five years I have been running all essential web services myself for more privacy and control over my data. | video of docker compose mailcow

Self-hosting is awesome, but currently it is very difficult to reliably run your own web services. |

My project will make this easier.

It is structured into five parts

The manager: A software to set up and manage the multi computer system,

The Operator: An easy application manager and installer: 

The Cloud APIs: An API, development and software ecosystem to make self-hosted app building easier

Basic apps for everyday use that are all using these cloud APIs

Thought out hardware solutions to self build or buy

By building upon the ever-growing Kubernetes ecosystem, the platform is not only useable by home users, but also by small businesses.

Since the start of the year, I researched and tested the viability of the ideas.
In March and April, I created the corporate design and website for the project.
Since then, I worked on the manager that installs the system
After Buildspace began, I showed the project to people other than friends and family for the first time.
