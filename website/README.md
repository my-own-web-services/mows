# Motivation

I wanted access to all my data across all my devices without compromising on privacy security or features. Other open source solutions failed me mostly because of their difficulty to maintain, their reliability or their lack of features.

Another problem I found is that there are hundreds of projects all solving the same or similar problems and not integrating with each other. Most of them could be built easily with a solid expandable cloud as base of them.
