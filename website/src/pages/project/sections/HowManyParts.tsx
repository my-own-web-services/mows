                                After a full system failure you can choose to recreate the cluster
                                from the backup. The process starts with the normal setup, but then
                                imports your operating and user data to restore everything. Some
                                encryption keys will change in the process.

                        The hardware part of the project aims to provide a well-integrated,
                        performant, cost-effective solution as a base for the system on top. You can
                        build it yourself from parts, or buy the assembled version to save some
                        time. To automate the installation on bare metal, and support as much
                        consumer hardware as much as possible, the manager is extended with a few
                        components and a cheap KVM solution is provided.

                                Pi-KVM is awesome, but it needs another computer with a full
                                operating system, that would need to be set up and could fail. We
                                already have three machines to manage and would need three more (or
                                a relatively expensive KVM switch) to manage them with Pi-KVM. So we
                                need to convert our existing machines into a KVM device. For the
                                video input, a cheap USB capture card can be used. To emulate a
                                keyboard, a USB host device would be required on the sending
                                machine, but this is rarely the case. To achieve this cheaply, a
                                custom solution was made that has a Pi Pico forwarding keystrokes to
                                the other computer, bridging this age-old flaw in the USB
                                specification.

                        The MOWS cloud APIs make it easy to develop web applications that are well
                        integrated with the MOWS ecosystem. Building on these APIs makes it possible
                        for apps to integrate with each other as well as sparing developers from
                        implementing basic requirements over and over again. The APIs are provided
                        through http, clients for different languages and directly through frontend
                        components.
