                    MOWS consists of five parts: Operator, Manager, Hardware, Cloud APIs and Apps.
                    The parts are designed to work together seamlessly, providing a complete
                    solution for managing your own web services without compromising on the
                    flexibility to run whatever you want.

                                access to the machine. The backup machine should reside at a another

                                at a friend's house, or on another persons cluster. The backups are
                                regularly checked for recovery viability. <br />
                                The backup also contains the cluster's configuration data, making it

                                after a whole-cluster failure. The full cluster restore procedure is

                            The hardware part of the project aims to provide a well-integrated,
                            performant, cost-effective solution as a base for the system on top. You
                            can build it yourself from parts, or buy the assembled version to save
                            some time. To automate the installation on bare metal, and support as
                            much consumer hardware as much as possible, the manager is extended with
                            a few components and a cheap KVM solution is provided.

                                Pi-KVM is awesome, but it needs another computer with a full
                                operating system, that would need to be set up and could fail. We
                                already have three machines to manage and would need three more (or
                                a relatively expensive KVM switch) to manage them with Pi-KVM. So we
                                need to convert our existing machines into a KVM device. For the
                                video input, a cheap USB capture card can be used. To emulate a
                                keyboard, a USB host device would be required on the sending
                                machine, but this is rarely the case. To achieve this cheaply, a
                                custom solution was made that has a Pi Pico forwarding keystrokes to
                                the other computer, bridging this age-old flaw in the USB
                                specification.

                            The MOWS cloud APIs make it easy to develop web applications that are
                            well integrated with the MOWS ecosystem. Building on these APIs makes it
                            possible for apps to integrate with each other as well as sparing
                            developers from implementing basic requirements over and over again. The
                            APIs are provided through http, clients for different languages and
                            directly through frontend components.
